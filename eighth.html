    <h1>في أمنيلله</h1>

    <p>You know... I kept asking myself this — <em>is this how it ends?</em> Is this really the final goodbye? The truth is, I don’t even know. Because a part of me refuses to believe that this is it. That this is the last time I get to write to you, the last time I get to feel close — even if it’s just through words on a screen.</p>

    <p>But life... life has its ways of making us accept things we’re not ready for.</p>
    
    <p>I never thought I’d meet someone like you — someone who’d shake my world, calm my storms, confuse me, comfort me, and still leave me wanting more. Someone who’d make me laugh, frustrate me, heal me, and unknowingly hurt me too.</p>
    
    <p>I never imagined that I’d have to live with the fact that the person I’d pray for — the person I’d wake up thinking about — was never mine to begin with.</p>
    
    <p>Yet, here I am... holding onto every memory like it’s the last gift I’ll ever receive. I don't know if we'll cross paths again, I don't know if life will be kind enough to give me that chance — but I do know this:</p>
    
    <p>You were special to me in ways you’ll never fully understand. You were my safe place, my chaos, my muse, my peace — all in one. And for that, no matter how far life takes me, a part of me will always remain here — with you.</p>
    
    <p>I won’t say goodbye, because I don’t want this to end that way. So I’ll just say this:</p>
    
    <p><em>If destiny ever brings you back to me, you’ll still find me waiting — a little older, maybe a little more broken, but still loving you the same.</em></p>
    
    <p>And if not, then know that I never lied when I said this —</p>
    
    <p>I love you Nida.</p>
