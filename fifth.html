    <h1>My Sisters Love You More</h1>

    <p>You know what’s still unbelievable to me?

        The fact that my whole family knows about you. And not just knows — they like you. Actually, adore you might be the better word.</p>

    <p>When I used to pray to Allah asking, “ to make me meet a girl at college” And Allah... He just knew better. I was out there praying for a college girl, while He sent me you. A woman who first met my parents </p>
    <p>And honestly? That makes the story sound divine.

        Now here’s the funnier part — if someday I go to my family and say, “I like her,” I swear they’ll just smile knowingly. My mom already calls you:
        “Kitni pyari bacchi hai, accha hai nahi milti tujhe, milni hi nahi chahiye.”
        Which is her poetic way of saying “you’re too good for me.” 😂</p>
    <p>And my sisters? They’re secretly your fans. Pretty sure they love you more than they love me on some days. So when I’m gone, you better guide them, okay?
        Be that cool elder sister</p>
    <p>I don’t know what life’s going to write next for us...
        But I do know, if meeting you was an accident then you meeting my parents wasn't just an accident, idk what happens next but if i fell for someone else would never be they way i fell for you, and somewhere i know if we were truly ment to be together this wont let us apart, if destiny lets us meets then Destiny always finds a way back too</p>
    <p>So until then...
        You’re my family’s favorite, my sisters’ guide, and my silent prayer still whispered at night.</p>
