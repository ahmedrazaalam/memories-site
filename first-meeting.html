    <h1>Our First Meeting</h1>

    <p>It was the first time I saw you at the library. I was so nervous that the first thing I said was, "You're tall." But that awkward line led to laughs and a spark that made me want to know you more. </p>

    <p>In the quiet of the library, you stood there in a purple dress, a mask hiding your smile, but your eyes... your eyes said everything. They were the most magnificent thing Iâ€™d ever seen â€” like stories I wanted to read forever. I didnâ€™t know then, that behind those eyes was the person whoâ€™d become my favorite in this whole world. Maybe it sounds ordinary, but for me, that moment was anything but like the beginning of a beautiful story I never want to end." âœ¨</p>
