    <h1>The Little Efforts That Meant the World</h1>

    <p>You know, Iâ€™ve been thinking â€” while Iâ€™ve always joked about you rejecting my date invitations (which you did, with style), I canâ€™t ever forget that youâ€™ve always been the one who actually made the real effort. </p>

    <p>You called me out for coffee.
        You reached out just to catch up.
        You made time â€” even when you didnâ€™t have to.
        And that? That meant everything to me.</p>
    <p>Youâ€™ll probably say, â€œStop being dramatic" but to me, it was never just that. It was time spent with you â€” time that, no matter how far life takes me, Iâ€™ll never forget, they were memories I packed carefully in my heart. Iâ€™ll carry them wherever I go. Because when someone like you makes the effort, even the smallest gesture feels grand..</p>
    <p>You gave me memories Iâ€™ll cherish forever. And honestly? I wish I could hit replay.

        But until then...
        Iâ€™ll just keep them safe, like my favorite movie I never get tired of watching in my head.</p>
        
    <p>And donâ€™t roll your eyes â€” thereâ€™s more.
        Go read the next part, idiot.</p>
