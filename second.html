    <h1>Crushing on you ever since</h1>

    <p>Youâ€™ve been the most beautiful friend I could have ever asked for. The one person Iâ€™ve always relied on, the only one Iâ€™ve ever truly spoken my heart to â€” and the only one who I believe truly understands me.

        I still remember how it all felt when we first started texting... how you made those little efforts that meant everything to me. The way you used to say, 'Weâ€™ll go to Cassedella someday,' or 'Letâ€™s sit at a cafe and talk for hours.' I donâ€™t know why, but somewhere along the way, I messed up the most beautiful thing I ever had. </p>

    <p>There was always something about you â€” your smile, your confidence, your little quirks, the way you chase your dreams â€” that made my heart quietly choose you. And no matter how much time passed or how close or distant we became, that admiration never left.</p>

    <p>I guess thatâ€™s why I call you my forever crush. Because even if nothing more ever comes of it, even if life takes us on completely different paths, Iâ€™ll always admire you from wherever I am. Youâ€™ve set a standard of beauty, grace, and goodness that no one else has ever come close to.</p>
    
    <p>And donâ€™t roll your eyes â€” thereâ€™s more.
        Go read the next part, idiot.</p>
