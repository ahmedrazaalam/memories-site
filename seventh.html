    <h1>The Girl Who Made Me a Poet</h1>
    
        <p>You know... youâ€™re the girl who made me a poet. Funny right? Because before you, I didnâ€™t even know how to express myself properly. But when my words werenâ€™t enough to justify what I felt for youâ€¦ when every sentence felt incomplete... I had no choice but to find new ways to say it.</p>

        <p>Because no matter how much I tried, I couldnâ€™t tell you directly. Not because I didnâ€™t want to, but because I was scared. Scared that if I told you, youâ€™d start keeping your distance. That youâ€™d pull away once you knew â€” I wasnâ€™t just your friend anymore. I couldnâ€™t be. I tried to be... but I had already fallen. I was in love with you.</p>
        
        <p>And you â€” well, you played your part well. You threw your hints, played me off-guard, as if unloving you would be that easy. Itâ€™s not. Not when your heart knows â€” sheâ€™s the one.</p>
        
        <p>So I became creative. I started writing. I wrote because I had no other way. Yeah sure, sometimes I used AI to help me sound cooler â€” but everything I wrote? It was my heart on paper.</p>
        
        <p>And it was never to convince you to be mine, but to let you know â€” there exists someone who just wants to care for you. Someone who wishes to understand you, be by your side, and never leave.</p>
        
        <p>But... you never gave me the chance.</p>
        
        <p>And yeah, I broke. But guess what? You also taught me how to deal with a broken heart. Funny how that worked â€” you shattered it, and you helped me fix it.</p>
        
        <p>It doesnâ€™t hurt now. Because Iâ€™ve told everything to Allah. And with all my sincerity and ikhlaq, I left it in His hands â€” for your well-being, not for you to be mine.</p>
        
        <p>And if one day, you find the right one â€” someone who makes you feel safe, happy, and loved... Iâ€™ll always smile. Because you found what you deserved.</p>
        
        <p>You better do. You deserve it.</p>
        
        <p>And me? Iâ€™ll always be around â€” maybe not in your life, but always in your duas, just like youâ€™ll always be in mine.</p>
