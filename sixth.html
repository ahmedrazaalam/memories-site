    <h1>My Favourite Passenger Princess</h1>

    <p>You know you’ll forever be my favourite passenger princess, right?</p>

    <p>I still remember the day I got my first car. The excitement I had when I texted you,
        “Wanna go for a ride?”
        And you, being you, with that classic line —
        “No, I don’t meet friends.”
        As if you’re some celebrity with tight security.
        But guess what? I didn’t give up. I literally had to kidnap you from the station — except, plot twist, I kidnapped your little sisters first because you wouldn’t budge.
        And they? They forced you to sit in the car. So technically, the kidnapping was their idea.</p>
        
    <P> Obviously, I had to treat both of y’all to ice cream — host duty things.
        But that was the beginning... of some of the most wonderful memories I’ve ever made —
        Car rides, spontaneous chai breaks...
        “Chai peene chale?” — my go-to line just to steal time with you.
        And yeah, I know — you’ll probably say, “I was only there because I wanted to help you get over her.”
        But me? I wasn’t there for that.
        I was there... because it was you.
        Because I wanted to spend time with Nida.</p>
        
     <p> I don’t even remember calling you to “help me.”
        What I do remember — is the excitement of meeting you.
        The same old songs you'd play, your idiotic yet funny things, and then you'd just leave — without even saying goodbye. Idiot fr.
        But you know what? You’re still the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known.
        
        People say energy is everything — and if anyone ever told me you have negative energy, I’d fight them on the spot.
        Because you?
        You’re the purest, the most white-hearted girl I’ve ever met.
        Like I always say — my white pigeon.</p>
        
    <p> I don’t know if we’ll ever go on car rides like that again.
        But I swear — I’d take any train back in time just to relive those days when you were my passenger princess.</p> 
        
     <p> Remember Founders Day?
        You in that red dress... OMG. I still remember. You looked — no, you were — breathtaking. Mashallah.
        And then this girl opens up and starts vibing to chapri raps. 😂
        That was the real Nida.
        The Nida that annoys, teases, and yet makes you want to never leave.
        
        And maybe... I won’t ever see that real Nida again.
        Because now you know I’m in love with you, and maybe that makes you hide yourself from me.
        And that breaks me more than you’ll ever know.
        
        Because I’ve seen you.
        I know who you are — I see beyond what you try to hide.
        
        And maybe one day — if life allows, if Allah wills —
        I’ll become so successful, not for me,
        but so that I can hold a hand — your hand —
        the one I know will never leave if I ever get to hold it.
        
        May Allah... guide us, heal us, write what’s best for us.
        But deep down? You’ll always be my favourite passenger princess.
        And no one can change that.</p>
