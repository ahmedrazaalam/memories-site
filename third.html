    <h1>My Unnecessary Efforts aka My Talent for Wasting yr time</h1>

    <p>Let’s not pretend you don’t know how many absolutely useless ideas I came up with just to spend time with you.</p>

    <p> “coffee pine chale?”</p>
    <p>  “movie chalegi kya!”</p>
    <p>   “Let’s go on a walk!”</p>
    <p>  “Let’s breathe the same air maybe?”</p>
        
     <p> And every time — every single time — you managed to reject me so respectfully that I almost felt proud of you for it. Like wow... the audacity but with elegance.
        
        But did that stop me? No. Because apparently, my talent lies in consistently annoying you while pretending I’m just “checking in.”</p>
        
     <p>  Let’s be honest — if they gave awards for “Most Ignored Yet Persistent,” I’d have a trophy shelf by now. But I guess that was my way of being close —
        Now that I’m leaving, don’t worry — your schedule just got 90% freer. No more fake dates to decline, no more random texts like “Hey, are you bored? Same.”
        But if someday you ever miss that annoying idiot who wouldn’t shut up — just remember, that was me. That’ll always be me.</p>
    <p>And don’t roll your eyes — there’s more.
        Go read the next part, idiot.</p>
